1. Vertex (node): fundamental part of graph.
2. Edge (arc): An edge connects two vertices to show that there is a relationship between them. Edges may be one-way or two-way.
3. Directed Graph (Digraph): All edges in graph are one-way. Class schedule is a digraph.
4. Weight: Edges might be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another.

Formal definition
G = (V, E), where G is graph, V is a set of vertices, and E is a set of edges.

Graphs Can be formed through
1. 2D Matrix
2. List with dict: In an adjacency list implementation we keep a master list of all the vertices in the Graph object and then each vertex object in the graph maintains a list of the other vertices that it is connected to
