1. Remove Dups: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list
   Follow up: How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
2. Return Kth to last: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
3. Write code to partition a linked list around a value of x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x. The partitionelement x can appear anywhere in the "right parition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
